## Installation

AlphaPeptStats can be used as 
 * python library (pip-installation), or 
 * Graphical User Interface (either pip-installation or one-click installer). 
 
Further we provide a Dockerimage for the GUI.

### Pip Installation

AlphaStats can be installed in an existing Python 3.8/3.9/3.10 environment with a single `bash` command. 

```bash
pip install alphastats
```

In case you want to use the Graphical User Interface, use following command in the command line:
 
```bash
alphastats gui
```

AlphaStats can be imported as a Python package into any Python script or notebook with the command `import alphastats`.
A brief [Jupyter notebook tutorial](nbs/getting_started.ipynb) on how to use the API is also present in the [nbs folder](nbs).


### One Click Installer

One click Installer for MacOS, Windows and Linux can be found [here](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphapeptstats/releases).


### Docker Image

We provide two Dockerfiles, one for the library and one for the Graphical User Interface.
The Image can be pulled from Dockerhub

```bash
docker pull elenakrismer/alphapeptstats_streamlit
```

## FAQ

### How can I resolve the Microsoft visual error message when installing: error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required. Get it with "Microsoft C++ Build Tools"?
Please, find a description on how to update required tools [here](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphapeptstats/issues/158).
