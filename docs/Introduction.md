AlphaPeptStats is an open-source package for analyzing mass spectrometry-based proteomics data.

AlphaPeptStats was developed to simplify and standardize the process of analyzing complex datasets. Hereby AlphaPeptStats supports proteomics data generated by `AlphaPept`, `DIA-NN`, `FragPipe` and `MaxQuant`. The tool allows a structured workflow from importing data, preprocessing data to visualization.
