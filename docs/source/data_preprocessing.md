# Data preprocessing

Preprocessing of the data is substantial for results of the downstream analysis.
Data preprocessing available in AlphaStats compromises: removal of contaminations, normalization, imputation and subsetting.

```
DataSet.preprocess(
    remove_contaminations = True,
    subset = False,
    normalization = 
    
)
```
